              Users may visit Tikdown App anonymously. We never record the
              identification information of our Users and will only collect
              personal identification information from Users if they voluntarily
              submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply
              personal identification information. However, if they agree to
              supply, they are responsible for providing exact and correct
              identification information of themselves. Tikdown is not
              responsible for any fake or incorrect information provided by the
              Users. If we discover such incidents, we would ban Users from
              accessing and using Tikdown App and our Services.

              We accept advertisements (Ads) on Tikdown App to maintain and
